# CSS-Display
The main of the repository is to clear the confusion among CSS Display properties. It has some demos too.

inline: It takes only the space required by the element(No margin / No padding)

block: It takes full space available in the width.

inline-block: Similar to inline but we can set margin and padding

none: To remove element from document flow.
